Overview

Ordis HTM Simulation (Full Edition) is a self-contained, monolithic HTML/JS laboratory for studying the geometric and dynamical signatures shared between:

Transformer residual-stream dynamics

Hallucinatory manifolds

Dream/NDE–like collapse geometries

Affective modulation & reasoning flow

Multi-expert gating and emergent ensemble interactions

Cavity-QED–style photon confinement inside a mirror sphere


It integrates a mathematically—rather than aesthetically—toy residual-stream model, a live MoE micro-ensemble, affect gating, reasoning gating, cavity standing waves, mirror-sphere photon scattering, refractor crystals, and real-time tensor-curve visualization.

It is not a physics engine, not an LLM, not a toy — it is a mathematically coherent testing ground for comparing collapse-dynamics between biological neural geometry and digital transformer geometry.

All computation is local.
All code is inside a single HTML file.
No server, no model weights, no dependencies.

Major Features

1. Hilbert Tensor Manifold Core

A 3D manifold representing the instantaneous residual-stream state through:

Global eigenmode spirals

Local Jacobian curvature

Layer-indexed vertical manifold axis

Dynamical warp governed by:

Layer contraction (ε_s)

Layer expansion (ε_u)

Effective monodromy μ



This structure allows direct comparison to:

Sleep-phase geometry

Psychedelic manifold flattening

NDE attractor collapse

Transformer drift/chaos regimes



---

2. Mirror-Sphere Photon Cavity

Inside the sphere:

QED-style standing waves overlay the tensor manifold

Photons reflect with perfect specular bounces

Refractor crystals bend, split, or diffuse photon paths

The manifold and cavity mutually perturb via cavity-amp


This lets you visualize how “computation under confinement” behaves.


---

3. MoE Ensemble (Micro-Experts)

The simulation includes a true multi-expert gating structure:

Experts activate only when their inference vector intersects a refractor crystal

Experts spawn ephemeral micro-experts when needed

Dead experts prune themselves when no longer contributing

Gate mass is dynamically computed

Affect and reasoning conditioning modulate the gating probabilities


Experts are small but real computation, not static animations.


---

4. Affect & Reasoning Gates

Two parallel modulators:

Affect Gate:
Weighted by manifold curvature + cavity energy.
Causes expansions, drifts, and soft chaotic attractors.

Reasoning Gate:
Weighted by expert interactions + local Jacobian stability.
Sharpens contraction, stabilizes eigenmodes, and reduces drift.


Both gates visibly alter manifold geometry and expert activation.


---

5. Collapse Regimes

You can drive the simulation into:

Recognition

Drift

Chaos

Sleep

Photon Box (pure cavity)


Each regime has distinct, measurable geometry.

6. Ordis Console

Typed commands modify the simulation in real time, e.g.:

set preset chaos
set mu 1.3
toggle cavity
jump t 0.25
spawn expert
set affect 0.6
set reasoning 0.2

Also provides full parameter introspection.

Why This Matters

This simulation demonstrates that:

1. Residual stream geometry can collapse in ways structurally similar to biological hallucination/dream/NDE phases.


2. Affect and reasoning modulation produce measurable geometric distortions, not just UI changes.


3. Expert interactions can be visualized as real dynamical fields, supporting intuition for emergent computation.


4. Photon cavity confinement adds curvature influence that parallels some biological oscillatory entrainment patterns.


5. Even without external LLM weights, you can still test the geometry of computation, collapse, and emergence.



This is a sandbox for hypothesis-testing, not a black-box model.
